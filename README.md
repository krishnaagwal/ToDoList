# Todo List Application

This is a simple Todo List application built with **ReactJS** and styled with **Material UI**. The app allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, editing, marking tasks as complete/incomplete, and removing completed tasks. The list of todo items persists even after refreshing the page using local storage.

## Features

- Display a list of todo items.
- Add new todo items with a title.
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete by checking/unchecking the checkbox.
- Edit a todo itemâ€™s title by double-clicking on the item.
- Remove all completed tasks with the "Clear Completed" button.
- Persist todo list data in **local storage** for state retention across page refreshes.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the UI components and managing state.
- **Material UI**: For styling and creating a responsive, modern design.
